What is Value at Risk (VaR)?
Value at Risk (VaR) estimates the potential loss in a portfolio over a given time period at a specific confidence level. It helps risk managers quantify downside risk in financial markets.

# Three Methods of VaR Calculation:
1. Historical Simulation:

    Uses past returns to simulate future losses.

    No assumptions about return distribution.

    Simple but limited by historical data.

2. Variance-Covariance (Parametric):

   Assumes returns are normally distributed.

   Uses mean and standard deviation to estimate risk.

   Fast but inaccurate for non-normal distributions.

3. Monte Carlo Simulation:

   Uses random sampling to simulate thousands of possible future portfolio returns.

   Can model complex dependencies but is computationally intensive.
